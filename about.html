                        <h2>The Bridge Hotel in Arklows History</h2>
                        <p>Built in 1827 The Bridge Hotel has been a beacon for many a weary sailor come home from afar
                            to
                            tell tales of far flung places. Arklow has a strong seafaring tradition going back through
                            the
                            ages, named after a Viking from the 9th century Arnkell. Its tradition remains today even
                            though
                            transformed to suit modern times. Sir Francis Chichesters yacht the Gypsy Moth III was built
                            in
                            Arklow by the Tyrrell family boatyard, they also built the ill-fated Asgard II built in 1981
                            which sank in the Bay of Biscay in 2008. Arklow still retains its maritime influence with
                            with a
                            new local marina to replace the wooden boats of old. Arklow also holds The Celtic Challenge
                            rowing race which is 96 miles from Arklow to Aberystwyth in Wales which is held every two
                            years.
                            The R.N.L.I aslo has a long history in the town with the oldest lifeboat station in Ireland.
                            <br><br>Arklow has many sporting clubs and societies including the local golf club which was
                            formed
                            in 1927 and is a commanding par 69. The many varied clubs range from bird clubs, sailing,
                            football, rugby, G.A.A. to musical with many marching bands and musical societies.<br><br>
